## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/elsayedzahran/E-Commerce-Fawry-Final-Project.git


## üöÄ Usage

1. **Start all services**, ensuring that the Discovery Service and Gateway Service are active.
   - The Gateway Service will provide the routing for API requests, and the Discovery Service ensures that the microservices can register and discover each other.

2. **Access the system via the gateway endpoints**:
   - **Order API**: `/api/orders` - Use this endpoint to place, update, and retrieve orders.
   - **Notification API**: `/api/notifications` - Access this API to send and receive notifications for order updates.
   - **Cart Items Service**: `/api/cart` - Add, remove, or update items in the shopping cart.
   - **Store Service**: `/api/store` - Retrieve product listings and manage product data.
   - **Coupon Service**: `/api/coupons` - Apply and validate discount codes.
   - **User Service**: `/api/users` - Manage user profiles, authentication, and preferences.

3. **Interact with the APIs** using tools like Postman, a frontend application, or any HTTP client that supports RESTful API calls.
   - You can perform POST, GET, PUT, DELETE operations as needed.
